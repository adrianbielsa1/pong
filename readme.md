# Pong
A simplistic web pong, made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Run it locally
- Install the `live-server` NPM package.
- Open the `front-end` folder using your shell of preference.
- Run `live-server --entry-file=index.html`.

The `--entry-file=index.html` argument is important because the folder structure is slightly different than the default one.
