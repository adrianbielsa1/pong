# Pong
A simplistic web pong, made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Run it locally
- Install the `live-server` NPM package.
- Open the `front-end` folder using your shell of preference.
- Run `live-server --entry-file=index.html`.

The `--entry-file=index.html` argument is important because the folder structure is slightly different than the default one.

## Special notes
The icons used in this site (which you can find on the [media](front-end/media) folder) were taken from [flaticon](https://flaticon.es) web-site; many of them were manually modified. Credits to the authors of these wonderful icons.
